He studies Basic Psychology under the supervision of Professor Dr. Xiaolin Zhou, and he is mainly keen on millisecond tactile information integration and computational social cognition. For the former, Shen focuses on how different tactile information is integrated and its temporal dynamics in the human brain. For the latter, he focuses on the computational and neural mechanisms of advantageous and disadvantageous unfair decision-making in Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s patients.\nAbstract In recent years, the use of high-precision computational models in social science, cognitive science, and affective neuroscience has increased dramatically. These models can be matched with empirical data to facilitate quantitative studies of the cognitive neural mechanisms underlying behavior. Yet most psychological researchers lack hands-on experience with computational modeling. In this tutorial, I will talk about decision-making tasks in social learning, and data-fitting using hierarchical Bayesian reinforcement learning (hBRL) models within a more comprehensive computational modeling framework. We collected behavioral data from 82 participants using the classic four-armed bandit task and explored the cognitive effects associated with each model parameter. Our tutorial provides more detailed theoretical and practical guidance to help novices to implement their own computational models and avoid common pitfalls.\n","permalink":"https://RLDMJC.github.io/posts/tutorialtalk/xu230826/","summary":"Recording https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qm4y1u7JU/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0\u0026amp;vd_source=1a260a61416c0a766c7c16e727b2f404\nSpeaker Shen Xu\nBio Shen Xu is a third-year Ph.D. student from the School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences at Peking University.

Following the release of GPT-4, my research interest has partially shifted towards understanding the emergence of intelligence within large language models.\nAbstract The exploration-exploitation trade-off, balancing the acquisition of new information with the utilization of known resources, is a fundamental dilemma faced by all adaptive intelligence. Despite our understanding of models based on normative principles, the diverse explore-exploit behaviors of natural intelligence remain elusive. Here, using neural network behavioral modeling and state space analysis, we examined the diverse human exploration behaviors under a novel two-armed bandit task, designed to simulate real-world environmental volatility where exploration becomes essential. Examining behavior in the belief state space of this task, we characterized the disparities across artificial agents with decision boundaries. To extend this analysis to human data, a circumstance where choices are too sparse in the belief state space, we trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to predict humans’ choices given past observations. This RNN model outperforms all existing cognitive models. Probing the RNN’s decision boundaries, we found substantial individual differences that evade classical cognitive models. Additionally, our RNN revealed a model-based pattern employed by humans in response to higher environmental volatilities. Our work offers a promising approach for investigating diverse decision-making strategies in humans and animals.\n","permalink":"https://RLDMJC.github.io/posts/researchrecap/xiong230809/","summary":"Recording https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1au4y1R7kh/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0\u0026amp;vd_source=e9626f9767e6e22ece9d765f34ba01c5\nSpeaker Huadong Xiong\nBio I am a first-year Ph.D student in the CNS program, the department of psychology at the University of Arizona, directed by Dr. Robert Wilson.
