Planning enables us to solve myriad everyday problems\u0026mdash;e.g., planning how to complete a list of errands on a busy day\u0026mdash;but planning is also very computationally demanding. How do we effectively plan despite fundamental constraints on our time, memory, and attention? My talk will cover recent work investigating how the flexible construction of task representations facilitates efficient planning in humans. I will discuss value-guided construal, a general formal theory of how people form simplified, ad hoc representations in order to plan and act. By investigating the computational principles that underlie how people construe problems, this approach provides a new perspective on the dynamic interplay of attention, causal reasoning, and goal-directed behavior.\n","permalink":"https://RLDMJC.github.io/posts/researchrecap/ho231004/","summary":"Recording https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1P94y1a7Kf/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0\u0026amp;vd_source=e9626f9767e6e22ece9d765f34ba01c5\nSpeaker Mark Ho\nBio Mark Ho is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stevens Institute of Technology.

Although anxiety has been related to decreased physical exploration and avoidance behavior, past findings on the interaction between anxiety and exploration during decision-making under uncertainty were inconclusive. The current study provides a holistic picture of the anxiety-exploration relationship by focusing on latent factors of trait anxiety and different exploration strategies when facing volatility-induced uncertainty. Across two well-powered online studies (N = 984), we demonstrated that people used a hybrid of directed, random, and undirected exploration strategies, which were respectively sensitive to relative uncertainty, total uncertainty, and value difference. The somatic factor of trait anxiety, the propensity to experience physical symptoms of anxiety, was inversely correlated with directed exploration and undirected exploration, manifesting as being less likely to choose the uncertain option and reducing choice stochasticity regardless of uncertainty. Trait somatic anxiety was also related to underestimation of relative uncertainty, which could potentially account for its negative impact on directed exploration. Together, these results reveal the selective role of trait somatic anxiety and physiological arousal in modulating uncertainty-driven and value-driven exploration strategies. If time permits, I will also present a follow-up study where we examined the relationship between transitory physiological arousal - indexed by real-time pupil size - and exploration strategies. We showed that pupil size positively correlates with total uncertainty, suggesting a selective role of physiological arousal in driving uncertainty-driven random exploration. Additionally, we were able to decode subject-specific uncertainty estimates from pupillary data, which improves the predictive power of participantsâ€™ trial-by-trial choice variability.\n","permalink":"https://RLDMJC.github.io/posts/researchrecap/fan230922/","summary":"Recording https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Rh4y1a7iq/?vd_source=e9626f9767e6e22ece9d765f34ba01c5\nSpeaker Haoxue Fan\nBio Haoxue Fan is a fifth-year graduate student at Harvard working with Dr. Elizabeth Phelps.

Previous studies have suggested that such evaluation relies on the reward experience accumulated by the reinforcement learning process in the brain. However, the core component of model-based decision-making\u0026ndash;working memory (WM), also retains reward information, and it is still unclear whether WM contributes to the evaluation. The current study analyzes four two-stage decision experiments, which separately manipulate two WM-related variables (delay and load). We found that time delay interfered with evaluating the ultimate consequences, while increased task load reduced cognitive effort in the feedback process and the probability of selecting the optimal option. Notably, our proposed models that corporated the reward-retained mechanism of WM could replicate the behavioral effects of delay and load, whereas the classical hybrid reinforcement learning model could not. Furthermore, individual-level analysis revealed a close correlation between model parameters and WM scores. Together, these results provide a deeper understanding of how reinforcement learning and WM co-work in complex decision-making and facilitate analysis of impaired model-based decision-making in clinical populations.\n","permalink":"https://RLDMJC.github.io/posts/researchrecap/zuo230909/","summary":"Recording https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Sj411C77e/?vd_source=e9626f9767e6e22ece9d765f34ba01c5\nSpeaker Zhaoyu Zuo\nBio Zhaoyu Zuo obtained a master\u0026rsquo;s degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the University of Science and Technology of China and is now a research assistant at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

These models can be matched with empirical data to facilitate quantitative studies of the cognitive neural mechanisms underlying behavior. Yet most psychological researchers lack hands-on experience with computational modeling. In this tutorial, I will talk about decision-making tasks in social learning, and data-fitting using hierarchical Bayesian reinforcement learning (hBRL) models within a more comprehensive computational modeling framework. We collected behavioral data from 82 participants using the classic four-armed bandit task and explored the cognitive effects associated with each model parameter.

Despite our understanding of models based on normative principles, the diverse explore-exploit behaviors of natural intelligence remain elusive. Here, using neural network behavioral modeling and state space analysis, we examined the diverse human exploration behaviors under a novel two-armed bandit task, designed to simulate real-world environmental volatility where exploration becomes essential. Examining behavior in the belief state space of this task, we characterized the disparities across artificial agents with decision boundaries. To extend this analysis to human data, a circumstance where choices are too sparse in the belief state space, we trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to predict humansâ€™ choices given past observations. This RNN model outperforms all existing cognitive models. Probing the RNNâ€™s decision boundaries, we found substantial individual differences that evade classical cognitive models. Additionally, our RNN revealed a model-based pattern employed by humans in response to higher environmental volatilities. Our work offers a promising approach for investigating diverse decision-making strategies in humans and animals.\n","permalink":"https://RLDMJC.github.io/posts/researchrecap/xiong230809/","summary":"Recording https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1au4y1R7kh/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0\u0026amp;vd_source=e9626f9767e6e22ece9d765f34ba01c5\nSpeaker Huadong Xiong\nBio I am a first-year Ph.D student in the CNS program, the department of psychology at the University of Arizona, directed by Dr. Robert Wilson.
